# WorkLog

This file documents my thought process, design decisions and implementation progress in chronological order.

## Technical Disclaimer

While defining [the development guideline](https://github.com/danilo-ambrosio/bookstore/blob/master/README.md), I didn't follow an MVP perspective/compressed architecture approach despite 
the few functional requirements and minor essential complexity. Aware of adding excessive design sophistication in the codebase, 
my idea is to show some important elements of my knowledge background, letting Sporty hiring team know a subset of my main technical skills.
Those concepts have been a solid foundation in my career to build successful solutions, working on high performance teams and meeting modern 
software requirements: scalability, responsiveness, maintainability, etc.

### Step 1: Requirements Analysis

First, I carefully read the functional requirements, spending more time with those would require more business logic (e.g. price/discount calculation).
In this phase, I like to draw class or sequence diagrams. Not much for documentation purpose, but mostly as design process helper.
Here's the first domain modeling draft on my whiteboard:

Manual drawing also helps me to roughly foresee architecture decisions and some required building blocks (entities, value objects, tests, controllers, so on).

By knowing that, I can also estimate the effort for each use case/user story. These bullets become fine-grained tasks that provides a more accurate personal progress indicator. 
Self time management gives peace of mind about not being delayed and is easier to do when the time box for each amount of work to be completed is short. The smaller sub tasks are, 
the better to have an accurate progress indicator.

### Step 2: Initial setup

Created project basic structure and added maven configuration. 

### Step 3: Domain Modeling and Unit Tests
